    "**Note:** In the remainder of this section, the terms \"likelihood\" and \"likelihood ratio\" are used to refer to the ratio of the probability of the data or posterior divided by the probability of the prior, both evaluated at a specific point. This ratio gets very large at any point where data appears (or, equivalently, the probability of the posterior is not small) but the prior predicts a very low probability of that happening. So, with this definition a large *likelihood* indicates the presence of very *unlikely* data if the prior is correct. You will see graphs labeled \"Likelihood\" which shoot up to extremely large values when the posterior exceeds the prior by a large factor.\n",
